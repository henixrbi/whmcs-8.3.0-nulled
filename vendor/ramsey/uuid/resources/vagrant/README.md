# Running Tests With Vagrant

To run tests using these instructions, you will first need to install
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). You should be able to use
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) with each environment. Other providers,
such as VMWare and Hyper-V, may be available, depending on the box used.
